# Vesting

Vesting is usually used to lock investors funds and unlock them using time-base function. This means investors still can
use their bound to gain profit by selling it or by using it for governance but can't just sell tokens on the market.

## Actions

As one investor can have more than one vesting contract assigned to him with different schedule we display a filterable
list of available contracts with action buttons. These buttons allow to view contract details, transfer contract
ownership to another account and release vested funds.

## Linear Vesting

Linear vesting is the simplest type of vesting. The amount of assets released over time follows a straight line, meaning the same fraction of the total amount is released every second.

### Linear Vesting with Cliff Delay

A cliff can be added to linear vesting, setting a cut-off point before which no assets are released. After the cliff, assets start releasing linearly.

<LinearCliffVestingPlot config={linearCliffVestingConfig} />

> {JSON.stringify(linearCliffVestingConfig)}

### Linear Vesting with Immediate Unlock

This type of vesting releases a portion of the assets immediately and then releases the remaining assets linearly over time.

<LinearImmediateUnlockPlot config={linearImmediateUnlockConfig} />

> {JSON.stringify(linearImmediateUnlockConfig)}

### Linear Vesting with Cliff Unlock

This type of vesting releases a portion of the assets immediately after a cliff period and then releases the remaining assets linearly over time.

<LinearCliffUnlockPlot config={linearCliffUnlockConfig} />

> {JSON.stringify(linearCliffUnlockConfig)}

## Exponential Vesting

In exponential vesting, the amount of assets released increases exponentially over time.

<ExponentialVestingPlot config={exponentialVestingConfig} />

### Exponential Vesting with Cliff Delay

A cliff can be added to exponential vesting, setting a cut-off point before which no assets are released. After the cliff, assets start releasing exponentially.

<ExponentialCliffVestingPlot config={exponentialCliffVestingConfig} />

> {JSON.stringify(exponentialCliffVestingConfig)}

### Exponential Vesting with Cliff Unlock

This type of vesting releases a portion of the assets immediately after a cliff period and then releases the remaining assets exponentially over time.

<ExponentialCliffUnlockPlot config={exponentialCliffUnlockConfig} />

> {JSON.stringify(exponentialCliffUnlockConfig)}

### Exponential Vesting with Immediate Unlock

This type of vesting releases a portion of the assets immediately and then releases the remaining assets exponentially over time.

<ExponentialImmediateUnlockPlot config={exponentialImmediateUnlockConfig} />

> {JSON.stringify(exponentialImmediateUnlockConfig)}

## Hyperbolic Vesting

In hyperbolic vesting, the amount of assets released increases quickly at the beginning and then slows down over time.

<HyperbolicVestingPlot config={hyperbolicVestingConfig} />

> {JSON.stringify(hyperbolicVestingConfig)}

### Hyperbolic Vesting with Cliff Delay

A cliff can be added to hyperbolic vesting, setting a cut-off point before which no assets are released. After the cliff, assets start releasing hyperbolically.

<HyperbolicCliffVestingPlot config={hyperbolicCliffVestingConfig} />

> {JSON.stringify(hyperbolicCliffVestingConfig)}

### Hyperbolic Vesting with Immediate Unlock

This type of vesting releases a portion of the assets immediately and then releases the remaining assets hyperbolically over time.

<HyperbolicImmediateUnlockPlot config={hyperbolicImmediateUnlockConfig} />

> {JSON.stringify(hyperbolicImmediateUnlockConfig)}

### Hyperbolic Vesting with Cliff Unlock

This type of vesting releases a portion of the assets immediately after a cliff period and then releases the remaining assets hyperbolically over time.

<HyperbolicCliffUnlockPlot config={hyperbolicCliffUnlockConfig} />

> {JSON.stringify(hyperbolicCliffUnlockConfig)}

## Monthly Linear Vesting

Monthly linear vesting releases a portion of the assets at the beginning of each month assuming each months equals 30 days.

<MonthlyLinearPlot config={monthlyLinearConfig} />

> {JSON.stringify(monthlyLinearConfig)}

### Monthly Exponential Vesting

Monthly exponential vesting releases a portion of the assets at the beginning of each month, with the amount released increasing exponentially.

<MonthlyExponentialPlot config={monthlyExponentialConfig} />

> {JSON.stringify(monthlyExponentialConfig)}

### Monthly Hyperbolic Vesting

Monthly hyperbolic vesting releases a portion of the assets at the beginning of each month, with the amount released following a hyperbolic curve.

<MonthlyHyperbolicPlot config={monthlyHyperbolicConfig} />

> {JSON.stringify(monthlyHyperbolicConfig)}

## Notes

- "afterCliffBasisPoints" can be increased to 10000 to implement a simple "Timelock Vesting"
- "period" can be increased to implement Weekly, Monthly, or Vesting of any custom period in step tranches
- "start" must be passed to schedule vesting activation, cliff period only begins counting after start timestamp
- "growthRate" only applies to exponential schedule, but must be passed in all schedules with default value
- "cliff" can be also applied to schedules with monthly steps and others
