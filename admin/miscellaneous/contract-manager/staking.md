# Staking

**StakingContractManager** is a contract that facilitates the deployment and management of staking contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides an easy-to-use interface for creating and deploying new vesting contracts, as well as managing existing ones.

### Deployment options:

- **contractTemplate** - Smart contract template with its unique functions. (can be *Simple* or *Refferal*)
- **maxStakes** - Maximum number of stakes allowed in the staking contract.

The contract validates the input and creates a new Staking contract on the blockchain.
