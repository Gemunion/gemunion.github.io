# Chain Link

[Chain Link](https://chain.link/) is a huge ecosystem that acts as an Oracle for blockchain.

Smart contract can't get any information from off-chain by itself thus required information must be passed to it from
off-chain by executing transaction. This is what ChainLink does. One of the data type which they can pass to blockchain
is random number. We use it in different mechanics
like [Mystery Boxes](/admin/mechanics-marketing/mystery/), [Lottery](/admin/mechanics-gambling/lottery/)
and [Raffle](/admin/mechanics-gambling/raffle/).

More information about how it works can be found [here](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf/)
